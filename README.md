# PF1 - SDP

This is my proof of coursework for Programming Foundations 1 - Systematic Program Design, following the textbook: [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/) and the edX courses, [How to Code: Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/learn/coding/university-of-british-columbia-how-to-code-simple-data) and [How to Code: Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/learn/coding/university-of-british-columbia-how-to-code-complex-data).

The prerequisite of PF2 - CBPD is the completion of [HTC](#htc).
