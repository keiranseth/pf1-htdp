# Cannibals and Missionaries Solver

This portfolio project is an implementation of a search problem which solves Cannibals and Missionaries puzzles.

After completing PF1, I still personally felt that there were not enough search problems in the course. To make sure that I learned the material, I'm implementing my own search problem with my own data definitions.
