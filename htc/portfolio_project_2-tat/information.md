# Tents and Trees Solver

This portfolio project is an implementation of a logic puzzle called [Tents and Trees](https://www.puzzle-tents.com/).

After completing PF1, I still personally felt that there were not enough search problems in the course. To make sure that I learned the material, I'm implementing my own search problem with my own data definitions.

## Implementation

> Download and run `project.rkt` here.

## How do I run the solver?

1. Download and install [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
2. Set the language to `Advanced Student`.
3. Run the program.
