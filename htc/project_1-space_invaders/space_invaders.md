# Space Invaders

This final project serves as the midterm project/exam. We are assigned to write a basic implementation of a [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) game.

Close this page if you're taking the course and have not completed your implementation of this project yet.

## Project

See [`space-invaders-ms.rkt`](./space-invaders-ms.rkt).

## Problem

What is [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)?

Now that you've taken some time to think about the problem and complete a domain analysis, download the starter file and read through it. We have provided constants and data definitions, but no other parts of the program.
