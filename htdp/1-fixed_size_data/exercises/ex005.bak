;Exercise 5. Use the 2htdp/image teachpack to create the image of a simple boat or tree. Make sure you can easily change the scale of the entire image.

(require 2htdp/image)

(define SCALE 4)

(define FOLIAGE (circle 16 "solid" "Deep Green"))
(define TRUNK (rectangle 16 64 "solid" "Brown"))
(define TREE (above FOLIAGE TRUNK))
