;Exercise 25. Take a look at this attempt to solve exercise 17:
;
;    (define (image-classify img)
;      (cond
;        [(>= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "tall"]
;        [(= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "square"]
;        [(<= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "wide"]))
;
;Does stepping through an application suggest a fix?
