;Exercise 33. Research the “year 2000” problem.

; The "year 2000" problem was basically, at the time, a predicted wide-scale problem because of a bug
; caused by computers' failure to distinguish how dates are formatted without the first two digits of the year.
; Like, 1902 is indistinguishable from 2002 in some computers. Because of this bug, there would financial losses.

; However, according to critics, it really wasn't that bad. Some companies anticipated this and had programmers and IT professionals
; fix this before it even became a problem. Even in places where the "Y2K" scare wasn't talked about, and
; no official memorandums were done to address this scare, minimal problems were encountered.
