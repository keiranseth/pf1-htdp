;Exercise 35. Design the function string-last, which extracts the last character from a non-empty string.

;; String -> 1String
;; Given a non-empty string, return the last character.
(check-expect (string-last "hello") "o")
(check-expect (string-last "Girliepop!") "!")

(define (string-last str) "z")
