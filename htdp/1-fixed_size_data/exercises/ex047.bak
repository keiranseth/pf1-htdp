;Exercise 47. Design a world program that maintains and displays a “happiness gauge.” Let’s call it gauge-prog, and let’s agree that happiness is a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
;
;The gauge-prog program consumes the current level of happiness. With each clock tick, the happiness level decreases by 0.1; it never falls below 0 though. Every time the down arrow key is pressed, happiness decreases by 1/5; every time the up arrow is pressed, happiness jumps by 1/3.
;
;To show the level of happiness, we use a scene with a solid, red rectangle with a black frame. For a happiness level of 0, the red bar should be gone; for the maximum happiness level of H, the bar should go all the way across the scene.
;
;Note When you know enough, we will explain how to combine the gauge program with the solution of exercise 45. Then we will be able to help the cat because as long as you ignore it, it becomes less happy. If you pet the cat, it becomes happier. If you feed the cat, it becomes much, much happier. So you can see why you want to know a lot more about designing world programs than these first three chapters can tell you.
