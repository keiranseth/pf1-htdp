;Exercise 56. Define main2 so that you can launch the rocket and watch it lift off. Read up on the on-tick clause to determine the length of one tick and how to change it.
;
;If you watch the entire launch, you will notice that once the rocket reaches the top something curious happens. Explain. Add a stop-when clause to main2 so that the simulation of the liftoff stops gracefully when the rocket is out of sight.

; An LRCD (for launching rocket countdown) is one of:
; – "resting"
; – a Number between -3 and -1
; – a NonnegativeNumber 
; interpretation a grounded rocket, in countdown mode,
; a number denotes the number of pixels between the
; top of the canvas and the rocket (its height)

; Why is this a good idea?
; Answer. Ideally, functions should only perform one atomic task.
;         If there are auxillary tasks, it should delegate it to auxillary
;         functions, and not perform that auxillary function itself. This
;         helps us follow the DRY principle in programming.
