;Exercise 60. An alternative data representation for a traffic light program may use numbers instead of strings:
;
;    ; An N-TrafficLight is one of:
;    ; – 0 interpretation the traffic light shows red
;    ; – 1 interpretation the traffic light shows green
;    ; – 2 interpretation the traffic light shows yellow
;
;It greatly simplifies the definition of tl-next:
;
;    ; N-TrafficLight -> N-TrafficLight
;    ; yields the next state, given current state cs
;    (define (tl-next-numeric cs) (modulo (+ cs 1) 3))
;
;Reformulate tl-next’s tests for tl-next-numeric.
;
;Does the tl-next function convey its intention more clearly than the tl-next-numeric function? If so, why? If not, why not?
