;Exercise 68. An alternative to the nested data representation of balls uses four fields to keep track of the four properties:
;
;    (define-struct ballf [x y deltax deltay])
;
;Programmers call this a flat representation. Create an instance of ballf that has the same interpretation as ball1. 


(define-struct ballf [x y deltax deltay])
;; Ball is (make-ballf NonNegativeInteger NonNegativeInteger Integer Integer).
;; Interpretation. (make-ballf x y deltax deltay) describes the ball's position and velocity, where
;;                 - x is the number of pixels from the screen's left side,
;;                 - y is the number of pixels from the screen's top side,
;;                 - deltax is the ball's horizontal velocity, and
;;                 - deltay is the ball's vertical velocity.
