;Exercise 70. Spell out the laws for these structure type definitions:
;
;    (define-struct centry [name home office cell])
;    (define-struct phone [area number])
;
;Use DrRacket’s stepper to confirm 101 as the value of this expression:
;
;    (phone-area
;     (centry-office
;      (make-centry "Shriram Fisler"
;        (make-phone 207 "363-2421")
;        (make-phone 101 "776-1099")
;        (make-phone 208 "112-9981"))))
