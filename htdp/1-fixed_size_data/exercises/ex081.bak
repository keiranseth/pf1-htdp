;Exercise 81. Design the function time->seconds, which consumes instances of time structures (see exercise 77) and produces the number of seconds that have passed since midnight. For example, if you are representing 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 2 seconds with one of these structures and if you then apply time->seconds to this instance, the correct result is 45002.

; Hour is Integer[0, 23]
; Interpretation. The number of hours in a time of day.

; Minute is Integer[0, 59]
; Interpretation. The number of minutes within a specific hour.

; Second is Integer[0, 59]
; Interpretation. The number of seconds within a specific minute.

(define-struct time (h m s))
; Time is a structure:
;    (make-time Hour Minute Second)
; Interpretation. (make-time h m s) is a specific time within a day, where
;                   - h is the current hour,
;                   - m is the number of minutes in the current hour, and
;                   - s is the number of seconds in the current minute.
