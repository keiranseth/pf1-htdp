;Exercise 82. Design the function compare-word. The function consumes two three-letter words (see exercise 78). It produces a word that indicates where the given ones agree and disagree. The function retains the content of the structure fields if the two agree; otherwise it places #false in the field of the resulting word. Hint The exercises mentions two tasks: the comparison of words and the comparison of “letters.”
