;Exercise 83. Design the function render, which consumes an Editor and produces an image.
;
;The purpose of the function is to render the text within an empty scene of image pixels. For the cursor, use a image red rectangle and for the strings, black text of size 16.
;
;Develop the image for a sample string in DrRacket’s interactions area. We started with this expression:
;
;    (overlay/align "left" "center"
;                   (text "hello world" 11 "black")
;                   (empty-scene 200 20))
;
;You may wish to read up on beside, above, and such functions. When you are happy with the looks of the image, use the expression as a test and as a guide to the design of render.
