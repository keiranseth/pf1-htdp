;Exercise 89. Design the happy-cat world program, which manages a walking cat and its happiness level. Let’s assume that the cat starts out with perfect happiness.
;
;Hints (1) Reuse the functions from the world programs in Virtual Pet Worlds. (2) Use structure type from the preceding exercise to represent the state of the world.
