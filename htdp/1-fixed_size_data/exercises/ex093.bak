;Exercise 93. Copy your solution to exercise 92 and modify the copy so that the chameleon walks across a tricolor background. Our solution uses these colors:
;
;    (define BACKGROUND
;      (beside (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "green")
;              (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "white")
;              (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "red")))
;
;but you may use any colors. Observe how the chameleon changes colors to blend in as it crosses the border between two colors.
;
;Note When you watch the animation carefully, you see the chameleon riding on a white rectangle. If you know how to use image editing software, modify the picture so that the white rectangle is invisible. Then the chameleon will really blend in.
